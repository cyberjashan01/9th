SEO Keywords
SEO keywords are words or phrases that people enter into search engines like Google to find specific information, products, or services. These keywords are used by search engines to match users with relevant content.

Types of SEO keywords:
1. Short-tail keywords: Brief, general keywords (e.g., "robotics").
2. Long-tail keywords: More specific phrases with lower competition (e.g., "robotics summer camps for kids").
3. Primary keywords: Main keywords targeted for a webpage or content (e.g., "Minecraft robotics").
4. Secondary keywords: Supporting keywords related to the primary keyword (e.g., "block-based coding", "STEM education").
5. Keyword phrases: Phrases containing multiple keywords (e.g., "robotics and coding for kids").

2. External links: Links from one website to another (e.g., linking from a blog post to a relevant article on another website).
3. Backlinks: Links from other websites to your website (e.g., another website linking to your blog post).
